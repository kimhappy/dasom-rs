A toy ray tracing engine based on [Ray Tracing In One Weekend](https://raytracing.github.io/books/RayTracingInOneWeekend.html) in Rust.

You can easily render images and add your own shapes or materials.

This will help you write your own ray tracer, especially in a Rust's functional way without `mut` 😉

[Examples](examples/) will be very helpful.
